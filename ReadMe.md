# DCS 7 Clock
#### By TIny_Hacker

### Overview:
Thanks for downloading DCS 7 Clock v1.1!
DCS 7 Clock is a digital clock that displays the current hour in twelve-hour time whenever ran from Doors CS.
To run Clock, make sure it is in the RAM, and then run it in Doors CS. You should see the previous icon become
the current hour, as well as whether it is Morning or Afternoon. Just remember to have the clock on your calculator
(accessible through [MODE]->Set Clock) is set correctly!

#### Installation:
Download dcs_clock.zip from either [Cemetech](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/2037/x2133) or [TICalc](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/475/47523.html). Open the zip file with an zip extracting program, and then send it to your calculator using
[TiLP](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/374/37481.html) or [TI Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw). Then you can run the program through DCS whenever you want.
